This is a one-screen Android application developed in **Kotlin** using **Jetpack Compose**, designed to fetch the user's current location using **Google Location Services**, and then send this location to the **Open-Meteo API** to retrieve real-time weather information. The project follows the **MVVM architecture**, uses **Koin** for dependency injection, and **Ktor** for networking.
